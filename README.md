# PORTFOLIO

The Portfolio Website is a professionally designed personal webpage that showcases my skills, projects, experience, and contact information in an interactive and visually appealing format. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website serves as a digital resume and personal brand identity hub.

It highlights my proficiency in front-end technologies and demonstrates real-time interactive features, clean UI/UX, and responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
